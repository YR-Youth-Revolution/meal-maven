                                Think about all the nutritional benefits you can get with a meal plan under $50. Indian meals abroad are not without hurdles. Either the challenges come in the form of cost, quality, availability, accessibility, or a blend of all the parameters. While running through the rush hours of the day, one might tend to compromise one's nutrition levels as it gets always tagged with any of the above-mentioned challenges.
