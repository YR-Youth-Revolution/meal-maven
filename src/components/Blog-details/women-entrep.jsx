                            <p>Today, the statement ‘Women in the kitchen’ is brimming with pride.</p>
                            <p>When the kitchen served as golden prisons for women back then, the same kitchen in a professional setting as in hotels and restaurants was particularly the men’s world of freedom.</p>
                            <p>Thanks to the women who walked ‘the road less travelled by’ and have turned the tables around with an innovative mind-frame combined with persistent effort.</p>
                            <p>Not only such women were successfully recognised as entrepreneurs, but they are the ultimate torchbearers who have paved the way for many women to walk the same road with confidence.</p>
                            <p>Given below is the list of 10 Indian woman entrepreneurs who have shaken the food industry all around the world.</p>

                            <h3>1. Rashmi Dega – Founder of Fresh Menu</h3>
                            <h4>‘Swimming against the tide is victory indeed’</h4>
                            <br /><br />
                            <p>From corporates to cloud kitchens, the story of Rashmi Dega cannot be overstated with her initial remarkable entry into the food-tech sector with the idea of Fresh Menu.</p>
                            <p>Launched in 2014; to revolutionize the way people eat from the aspect of convenience, she had seen it coming. In a period when ‘fast food’ and ‘Indian Tiffen Services’ were not easily pronounced, her advent of delivering fresh gourmet-style meals to customers' doorsteps was a challenge of its time.</p>
                            <p>A rotating menu with world cuisine and regional specialties like Mexican rice bowls and roti & sabzi is what you call ‘Fresh menus are refreshing’.</p>
                            <p>Although way ahead of its time, the eventual catching up with the trend of food delivery is quite true.</p>

                            <h3>2. Avni Biyani - CEO & Group Head Food Stories</h3>
                            <h4>‘Change transcending to transformative is when real change is happening’</h4>
                            <br /><br />
                            <p>In 2011, Ashni Biyani and her sister co-founded "Food Hall," a revolutionary premium lifestyle food retailing experience at Palladium Mall in Mumbai, as retailing evolves.</p>
                            <p>By 2024, Food Hall had evolved into Food Stories, offering an experience environment to taste and celebrate Indian and international cuisines for urban-Indian travelers.</p>
                            <p>The speciality of Food Stories is its grand ambience stocked with curated sections of cheese, and other fresh produce from domestic and also other global brands.</p>
                            <p>The differentiation aspect of Food Stories is its compelling narrative of food as an experience that has captured global attention.</p>

                            <h3>3. Manjari Singh and Hiranyami Shivani – Founders of The Chhaunk</h3>
                            <h4>‘Serving traditions can never go outdated’</h4>
                            <br /><br />
                            <p>The birth of Chhaunk is specifically marked by passion meeting tradition.</p>
                            <p>Accordingly, the dynamic duos of ‘Chhaunk’, mother-in-law and daughter-in-law have defied the cliché of catfights.</p>
                            <p>During the pandemic lockdown in Delhi, a cloud kitchen with authentic Bihar cuisine was conceived in 2021 to fill the void.</p>
                            <p>While Hiranyami entails her responsibilities towards bringing freshly prepared traditional cuisines to the table, Manjari Singh seeks the operational and business aspects of it.</p>
                            <p>With a focus on expanding to new regions and territories, Chhaunk stands as a testimonial in revealing the true power of family ties and collaborative spirit.</p>

                            <h3>4. Dipna Anand- Co-Owner of The Brilliant Restaurant</h3>
                            <h4>‘Blending in the richness of fusion cuisines’</h4>
                            <br /><br />
                            <p>London is spiced up with the harmonious blend of Punjabi and Kenyan cuisines by Dipna Anand, the third-generation chef who is taking the legacy forward with glint and gleam.</p>
                            <p>Brilliant restaurant’s humble journey began from Kenya in the 1950s to the present London.</p>
                            <p>Beyond her role as a co-owner, she is also well-known for wearing multiple hats as a culinary educator and an author of her recent cookbook named, ‘Dipliciously Brilliant’.</p>
                            <p>In committing to taking forward her family legacy, Dipna Anand is pushing herself to embrace new horizons thereby reaching newer heights.</p>

                            <h3>5. Seema Sanghavi- Founder of Cooks Who Feed</h3>
                            <h4>‘A business-led with a purpose’</h4>
                            <br /><br />
                            <p>Although the paradoxical existence of hunger and food waste cannot be completely eradicated, still it can be eliminated to a significant extent.</p>
                            <p>As proof, Seema Sanghavi's social venture, Cooks Who Feed, serves 100 meals through non-profit partnerships for every apron sold.</p>
                            <p>Beyond feeding the needy, the firm organically combines a sustainable approach by providing equitable working conditions for the marginalized apron maker. By garnering attention for the social good, the business brought in transformative results.</p>

                            <h3>6. Chetan and Roshni Dahl- Founders of Heart to Home</h3>
                            <h4>‘True happiness comes when it gets served and shared’</h4>
                            <br /><br />
                            <p>The pair founded ‘Heart to Home’ to accommodate Canada's rising senior population by offering homemade food delivery services with freshly prepared meals with full customization.</p>
                            <p>Seniors who struggle to cook bread or have reduced mobility can get fresh, tasty, and nutritious meals from Heart to Home Meals.</p>
                            <p>With a focus on enhancing the quality of life, the couple has certainly moved the usual trajectory of the food business towards making a social impact.</p>

                            <h3>7. Dipti Motiani- Founder of Second Nature</h3>
                            <h4>‘Skyrocketing from Engineering to Entrepreneurship’</h4>
                            <br /><br />
                            <p>Although hailed from Carnegie Mellon University, her calling was certainly from the cold-pressed fruit extracts.</p>
                            <p>Second Nature chooses to stay differentiated in developing nutritional beverages free from added preservatives and thereby retaining the natural essence.</p>
                            <p>By expanding into top-tier Indian cities and using Amazon, the business is poised for fast growth.</p>

                            <br /><br />
                            <p>Deeply inspired by her family’s deep-rooted tradition in the culinary domain, Pooja Dhingra found a natural inclination to the world of culinary arts.</p>
                            <p>However, her hospitality management studies in Switzerland, and her experience in French pastry at Le Cordon Bleu, Paris fueled her love deeper.</p>
                            <p>After starting Le 15 Patisserie in 2010, the "Macaron Queen" pioneered the Indianization of macarons and other French confections.</p>
                            <p>While a steadfast growth journey is happening, she still chooses to live by her philosophy of ‘keep it moving’ by opening different gateways of opportunities.</p>
