                                ‘Doing it all by yourself’ as appealing as it may sound to project self-explanatory terms like hyper-independent or self-made has a distressing true side too. A side that is moderately spoken amidst the public eye is where it gets all excruciating and cumbersome. Especially when you have backpacked to pursue your ambitions from India to a foreign land or set foot on the growth path of that professional ladder, that’s when it hits even harder to realise the significance of affording help. Be it a student running after course or a working professional, chasing deadlines and meetings in Canada, affording help to wrap around your necessities like home food becomes the wise option. With the surge in global food delivery platforms since the pandemic, the meal delivery market of Canada is expected to gain about 22.9 million users in the year 2029. More so, with a widespread Indian consumer base in Canada, the demand for home-cooked meal delivery options is very much pressing each year.
                                If you are looking Indian meal delivery service in your Canadian neighbourhood, here are a few lookouts,
